This project implements a hybrid architecture combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViT) for image classification on the CIFAR-100 dataset. The primary objective is to leverage the inductive biases of CNNs for low-level feature extraction while utilizing the self-attention mechanisms of transformers for global context modeling.

## Problem Statement

### Challenge

Image classification on CIFAR-100 presents several challenges:

- **High inter-class similarity**: Many classes in CIFAR-100 share visual characteristics
- **Limited data per class**: Only 500 training images per class
- **Low resolution**: Images are only 32×32 pixels
- **Fine-grained classification**: 100 classes require learning subtle distinctions

### Traditional Approaches

Pure Vision Transformers, while powerful, often struggle with small datasets due to their lack of inductive biases. Standard CNNs, conversely, may miss long-range dependencies crucial for distinguishing similar classes.

---

## Methodology

### Hybrid Architecture Approach

The solution employs a hybrid architecture that:

1. **Replaces linear patch embedding** with a convolutional stem
2. **Extracts hierarchical features** using strided convolutions
3. **Applies transformer blocks** for global reasoning on extracted features
4. **Combines local and global processing** for improved performance

### Key Design Decisions

**Convolutional Stem**
- Three-layer CNN progressively downsamples the input
- BatchNorm and ReLU activations for stable training
- Reduces spatial dimensions from 32×32 to 8×8

**Transformer Configuration**
- 8 transformer blocks with 6 attention heads
- Embedding dimension of 384 for efficient computation
- Stochastic depth for regularization

**Training Strategy**
- Heavy data augmentation (AutoAugment, ColorJitter, RandomErasing)
- Label smoothing (0.1) to prevent overconfidence
- Cosine annealing learning rate schedule
- AdamW optimizer with weight decay

### Convolutional Stem Details

The convolutional stem progressively processes the input:

| Layer | Input Size | Kernel | Stride | Output Size | Features |
|-------|-----------|--------|--------|-------------|----------|
| Conv1 | 32×32×3   | 3×3    | 1      | 32×32×64    | 64       |
| Conv2 | 32×32×64  | 3×3    | 2      | 16×16×128   | 128      |
| Conv3 | 16×16×128 | 3×3    | 2      | 8×8×384     | 384      |

### Transformer Block Architecture

Each transformer block consists of:
- Multi-Head Self-Attention (6 heads)
- Layer Normalization
- Feed-Forward Network (MLP with 4× expansion)
- Residual connections
- Stochastic depth (linearly increasing rate)

The model was trained for 103 epochs (interrupted) with the following observations:

**Early Training (Epochs 0-20)**
- Rapid initial learning: accuracy increased from 5.08% to 51.14%
- Loss decreased from 4.37 to 2.34
- Model quickly learned basic feature representations

**Mid Training (Epochs 20-50)**
- Steady improvement: accuracy reached 63.75%
- Loss continued decreasing to ~1.98
- Learning rate gradually decreased with cosine schedule

**Late Training (Epochs 50-103)**
- Convergence phase: accuracy stabilized around 66.67%
- Loss plateaued at ~1.53

## Analysis

### Strengths of the Hybrid Approach

**1. Improved Inductive Bias**
- Convolutional stem provides translation equivariance
- Better suited for image data than pure patch embedding
- More parameter-efficient feature extraction

**2. Hierarchical Feature Learning**
- Progressive downsampling captures multi-scale features
- Low-level features (edges, textures) extracted by CNN
- High-level features (objects, context) captured by transformer

**3. Computational Efficiency**
- Reduced sequence length (64 vs 256 patches for standard ViT)
- Faster attention computation
- Lower memory requirements

### Performance Analysis

**Comparison to Baselines:**
- Standard ResNet-50 on CIFAR-100: ~75-78%
- Pure ViT on CIFAR-100 (without pre-training): ~50-55%
- This hybrid approach: 66.67%

The hybrid model performs between pure CNNs and pure transformers, suggesting that while the combination is beneficial, there's room for optimization.
